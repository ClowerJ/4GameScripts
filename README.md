# 4GameScripts
Authotkey Script to read and control multiple instances of an old game

NEED memory addresses so accurately read information per window<br/>
MAYBE once functionality is sufficient may make a GUI to streamline use<br/>

TODO:<br/>
Access and assign memory locations to atrributes to be monitored<br/>
Add tests to see if memory locations change upon reinitialization(use pointers?)<br/>
Define actions for the playercharacters to perform based on incoming information from memory access<br/>
Movement controls to follow or make a formation based on lead window<br/>
Create alert if something gets hung up or does not function<br/>
<br/>
Class specific functions once the basics are met<br/>
Design a GUI to better monitor multiple windows and defines settings for its current function without having to stop/start
